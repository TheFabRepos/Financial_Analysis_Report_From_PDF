These investments are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology that incorporates a number of assumptions including the weighted average cost of capital, long-term growth rates, and exit multiples. The assumptions used in valuing these investments are based on observable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the investee. We believe the fair value of non-marketable equity securities to be within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on observable transactions and quotes that are not as reliable as those used for Level 2 investments."]], "description": " Non-marketable equity securities fair value estimation, 2022.", "source": "2022-alphabet-annual-report.pdf_page_95_table_2"}
